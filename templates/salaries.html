                    <p>We wanted to take a look at the total value of salaries paid out to players for the 2020-21 NBA season. In this sunburst chart, we can visualize the hierarchical salary totals from as high-level as the entire league all the way down to the individual player on each team. Overall, there does not seem to be too big of a difference when it comes to the amount spent on player salaries on the conference and division levels.</p>
                    <p> Click on the desired level of granularity and hover over the slice to view the salary total.</p>
                    <p>Player salary values were obtained from scraping the table data hosted on the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/year/2021/seasontype/5">ESPN Player Salaries</a> pages.</p>
